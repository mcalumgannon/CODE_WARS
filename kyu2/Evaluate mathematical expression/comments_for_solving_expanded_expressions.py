# split expression into list

# find all numbers
# negative always have - before them
# number, operator, number
# if no operator, than +
# solve all mini expressions in order than replace the mini operation with answer E.g
#   2+3+4 = 5+4 = 9
# if operator = +: prev + next
# if operator = -: prev - next
# if operator = *: prev * next 
# if operator = /: prev / next
