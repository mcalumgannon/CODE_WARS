# Certainly! The code calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a matrix exponentiation approach. I'll explain the code step by step:

# The fib function is the main function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number, whether positive or negative. It first handles the base cases for n being 0, 1, or -1, where the Fibonacci values are 0, 1, and 1, respectively.

# It initializes two variables a and b to 0 and 1. These will be used to keep track of the Fibonacci numbers in the loop. a represents the (n-1)th Fibonacci number, and b represents the nth Fibonacci number.

# It determines the sign variable, which helps to handle negative n values. If n is negative and even, the sign is set to -1; otherwise, it's set to 1. This ensures that the function returns the correct sign for negative Fibonacci numbers.

# The code then makes n positive using n = abs(n) to simplify calculations for negative n.

# The transformation_matrix is a 2x2 matrix that represents the transformation required to calculate Fibonacci numbers. It's set to [[1, 1], [1, 0]]. You can think of this matrix as the matrix that takes the (n-1)th and nth Fibonacci numbers and transforms them into the nth and (n+1)th Fibonacci numbers. The matrix multiplication is used for this transformation.

# Inside the fib function, there are two helper functions:

# multiply_matrix(A, B): This function takes two 2x2 matrices A and B and performs matrix multiplication. Matrix multiplication of A and B results in a new matrix.
# power_matrix(M, n): This is a recursive function that calculates the matrix M raised to the power of n. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach, where it splits the problem into smaller parts and combines them efficiently. This function is key to efficiently calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
# The power_matrix function is used to calculate powered_matrix, which represents the transformation matrix transformation_matrix raised to the power of n-1. The result, powered_matrix, is a 2x2 matrix, and we're interested in the value in the top-left position of this matrix.

# The result is calculated by taking the sign into account and multiplying it with powered_matrix[0][0]. This gives the nth Fibonacci number.

# The fib function then returns the result.

# In summary, this code uses matrix exponentiation to efficiently calculate the nth Fibonacci number, even for large values of n. It also takes care of the sign for negative Fibonacci numbers. The divide-and-conquer approach in the power_matrix function is used to optimize the calculation, making it faster than a straightforward recursive method.
