# initialize an empty list 'sequence' to represent the sequence of numbers.

# initialize two pointers 'i' and 'j' to track the next elements to consider for sequence.

# iterate while length of 'sequence' is less than or equal to 'n'.

#     calculate 'y' by doubling the element at index 'i' of 'sequence' and adding 1.

#     calculate 'z' by tripling element at index 'j' of 'sequence' and adding 1.

#     compare 'y' and 'z' to determine which one is smaller.

#     if 'y' is smaller, append 'y' to 'sequence' and move 'i' pointer to next element.

#     if 'z' is smaller, append 'z' to 'sequence' and move 'j' pointer to next element.

#     if 'y' and 'z' are equal, only append one of them and update both pointers.

# return nth element in 'sequence' as result.
