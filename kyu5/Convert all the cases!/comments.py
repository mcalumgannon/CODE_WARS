    # initialize an empty list to store the converted phrase
    # this list will be used to build the converted output phrase.

    # initialize variables to keep track of word boundaries
    # 'is_new_word' indicates the start of a new word.
    # 'is_first_word' is used to identify the first word in the phrase.

    # iterate through each character in the input phrase
    # this loop processes each character in the input phrase and converts it to the desired case format.

        # ensure that the phrase starts with a lowercase letter
        # this part enforces that the phrase should start with a lowercase letter.

        # check if the character is a word boundary and handle it
        # depending on the naming convention, this section handles word boundaries differently (underscores or hyphens).

        # handle the character based on the target_case
        # depending on the desired naming convention (camel, snake, or kebab), this part processes the character accordingly.

    # join the converted characters to form the new phrase
    # the converted characters are joined together to create the final output phrase, adhering to the desired naming convention.
